Simple Image Viewer
====================

	Overview
	=========

		Simple image viewer is created for my personal usage and
		it does not very much. Just what I need ;)

		Reason why I wrote siv is simple: I tried to make a bash 
		script what will just use CURL to download image, then use 
		some imageviewer to load that image, then sleep couple of seconds, 
		then load another image and then just show that image.

		There was a problem. I didn't find any smart way to change
		image to image viewer what was already open. I tried couple of
		Image Viewers, but I didn't made them work as I wanted. 

		In one image viewer there was a "refresh" command what took
		argument that how many seconds it should wait until refresh.
		Well, that didn't made the trick for my usage, because I never
		knew how long image will be loaded until it is loaded. 
		
		So I tried another image viewer. There was automatically reload if
		image has changed. Well, that left halfly loaded images in UI
		because curl was writing to that file and image was redrawn
		couple of times, but still that was broken in UI when download
		of image was complete. So, it didn't made what I need.

		Then I tried to find an application what can take "load" command
		from CLI to already running instance of that application, so
		I do not need to do "killall" and "some_image_viewer_here image.jpg"
		every time when I download new image and overwrite the old one.
		Also, I didn't want to press any button to "refresh" image, because
		I want that I can make a script what does that for me.

		So, then I just decided to write this kind of application if
		I can, and I made it as good as I needed. This is _not_ tested
		well, there might be memory leaks, it might crash the whole universe
		but I don't care. If you find bugs, send me patches or at least
		send me a mail and just tell if there is any fatal. I might or
		might not fix it.

	Usage
	======

		You can load image with CLI parameter:
			./siv /tmp/yourimage.jpg

		When you have SIV running, you can load another image typing
		in CLI this:
			echo "load /tmp/some_image.jpg" > /tmp/iv_fifo

		You can toggle fullscreen using key "f" and/or via FIFO:
			echo "fullscreen" > /tmp/iv_fifo
